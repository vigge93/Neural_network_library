# What is this
This is library for creating neural networks based on Daniel Shiffmans toy neural network. 

### What types of networks are supported?
Currently, only fully connected networks can be created.

### Which algorithms are implemented?
There are three classes that can be used for creating AI
* Supervised neural network - Used for supervised learning
* Evolutionary neural network - Used for evolutionary algorithms
* Population - An easier way to use evolutionary algorithm, doesn't work for all applications.
